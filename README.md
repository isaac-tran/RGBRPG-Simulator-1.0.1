Thank you to Tallbeard Studios for hosting the OST Jam Vol. 4, which was the motivation for this game's existence (as much as I stressed myself out to meet the deadline, it has been a fun experience). Thank you to Kenney for their free art and SFX assets, and also to the wonderful artists behind the songs in this game and  in the album itself.

Have fun!
